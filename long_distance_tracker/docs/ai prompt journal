# AI Prompt Journal 

## Purpose

This document records notable AI prompts, the intent behind them, which model/assistant was used, key outputs, and follow-up actions. Use it to keep track of interactions, reproduce results, and improve prompts over time.

---

## How to use

- Add a new entry for each distinct prompt or prompting session.
- Keep entries concise and focused: record the prompt, context, goal, model, and outcome.
- Link to related files, commits, or issues when applicable.

## Example entries

### 1) Create `docs/toolkit.md` (2025-12-17)

Date: 2025-12-17
Time: 10:02
Author: Bruno
Assistant: GitHub Copilot (model: Raptor mini (Preview))
Intent: Create a clear repository toolkit documentation describing each implementation and how to run them
Prompt: "create a toolkit.md for this file"
Context:
- Repo contains FastAPI, Flask, Node+Express, Rust Actix implementations
- `openapi.yaml` defines the API contract
Output summary: Added `docs/toolkit.md` with overview, quick-start commands, API examples, troubleshooting, and contribution notes (file saved).
Follow-up: Offer to add Postman collection or run scripts (user accepted next to create an AI prompt journal)
Tags: #doc #onboarding

### 2) Create `docs/ai prompt journal` (2025-12-17)

Date: 2025-12-17
Time: 10:12
Author: Bruno
Assistant: GitHub Copilot (model: Raptor mini (Preview))
Intent: Create an AI Prompt Journal template and add example entries
Prompt: "create a ai prompt journal for this file"
Context:
- `docs/toolkit.md` had just been created
- File `docs/ai prompt journal` existed but was empty
Output summary: Populated `docs/ai prompt journal` with purpose, usage, template, and two example entries (including the toolkit record).
Follow-up: Keep recording future prompt sessions and optionally add automation to append entries from a canonical log
Tags: #doc #process

## Tips for better prompts 

- Be explicit about the desired format (e.g., "Create a markdown file with headings and examples").
- Provide repository context or relevant filenames.
- If the output will be edited programmatically, request machine-friendly formats (JSON, YAML, or clear templates).
- When iterating, include the previous assistant response for continuity.
